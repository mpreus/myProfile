# myProfile
Several words about me, the technologies I use, what's my passion etc.
The site is build almost entirely on vw and vh units, so it should have the same appearance on various screens. 
I try to attach a link to corresponding file when in Technologies section I claim I have a particular skill. This way one may see / verify what I acctually have done so far on the path to Frontend development.
The site stiil is being developed, so it may appear slightly different when I add news features.
